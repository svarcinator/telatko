I'm using constants for positions of keys, gates, traps, ...

Variable robot_pos is current position of robot and variable puddle is position of puddle or value -1, if the puddle has been already visited. 
Variable rusting_limit counts number of steps after visiting puddle (init value of rusting_limit is 4, it decreases with every step when robot is rusting).
